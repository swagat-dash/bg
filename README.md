For the cms of "products page" for admin panel, I have made x-editable form. It will require you to include php inside json.

temporary hosting (for 2-3 days)

freewebhostingarea.com 

id: www.bgtechno.in
password:"rahul12345"   (without the double quotes)

then we will buy a paid hosting and shift to it...

the files and directories in the ROOT are COMMON for retailer,distrubutor and even admin...

the "retailer" directory is the retailer panel...
the "distributor directory is the distributor panel...
